#### With lots of love from your Chikorita Babe
**(whose evolution in your life has been as follows)** 


- From being a **"Grammar Nazi sarcastic bhalo meye"** your dada told you about who scrinshutted things for you
- to becoming your **German Dessert Chikorita** despite the worst deflection tactic of all time (PUCK-PUCK-PUCK)
- to being a **Sweet summers child** who went AWOL and resurfaced via email MONTHS later (I'm REALLY sorry)
- to being **Bara Dank Tadpole** with her proximity crush after the prissybetch prank
- to my final evolution into a **"CM-Fearing Potol Eating Plebby Name Lovin' Tor-Baap Sticker Making Raagi Cartoon Babe"


### Squishie maxx from Dank Tadpole to her Paul Pew Pew

#### I'm lucky to have known you all these years and I can't imagine not having you as a part of my life. I love you more than 3000.
