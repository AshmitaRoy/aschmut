I hope with my 'AI Coding Skills' I can make some for you.

#### With lots of love from your Chikorita Babe
**(whose evolution in your life has been as follows)** 

- From being a **"Grammar Nazi sarcastic bhalo meye"** your dada told you about who scrinshutted things for you
- to becoming your **German Dessert Chikorita** despite the worst deflection tactic of all time (PUCK-PUCK-PUCK)
- to being a **Sweet summers child** who went AWOL and resurfaced via email MONTHS later (I'm REALLY sorry)
- to being **Bara Dank Tadpole** with her proximity crush after the prissybetch prank
- to my final evolution into a **CM-Fearing Potol Eating Plebby Name Lovin' Tor-Baap Sticker Making Raagi Cartoon Babe**

<h3 style="background-color:GOLD">  2019 Letter </h3> 
<span style="background-color: PAPAYAWHIP;"> So many people have asked me Why and HOW I‚Äôm friends with you after all these years. 
In my head, the answer is simple but I guess it isn‚Äôt to outsider perspectives. I used to say ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs because Prithvi is just the nicest person ever‚Äù but it‚Äôs not just that. You‚Äôre not just nice, you‚Äôre such a kind, dependable, intelligent, considerate, generous, patient, sensitive, starving, good human being and I‚Äôm beyond lucky to have you in my life, no ragretz about anything. Everything is just easy and comfy with you and I hope we never stop with the witty bants, the teleprithvi, the scandalous inside jokes, the millennial lingo tewshun, the random TMI-ness and just being there for each other through everything. If the strength of the love and friendship we share can help you overlook the SUPREME betrayal of me eating the occasional egg biryani or potol bhaja, we‚Äôre going to be annoying each other for a long long time. PS: I beg you to yeet that poem sanitiser and those cringe max wallet notes into the void the mere thought of them makes me want to commit sudoku. </span>
<br>
### All my love to my literal world, jk you‚Äôre still Tokapi, many potols to you from Chikorita. I'm lucky to have known you all these years and I can't imagine not having you as a part of my life.
#### I love you, more than 3000.
## All my best, Aschmut.
